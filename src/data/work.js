This project replaced the need of a third-party instrument-control softare that costed the company hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. I was in charged of both building the backend (a Rest API) in Python that talked to the instruments and a web browser interface in JavaScript and HTML that comminucated with the backend to fetch and stream data from the instruments. I used PostgreSQL to store the data. The project was then deployed with Docker and Kubernetes.",
